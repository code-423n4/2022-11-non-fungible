Hey, for me there is no "Submit Finding" button displayed on the contest page. Is this intended and will be displayed later?

Hi everyone! Is this a fork of the blur exchange? or it this a common pattern between nft exchanges? the architecture and code looks pretty similar

Heyy @contest-anon , DMed for a question


[11/13/2022 09:49] dravee
Going through the instructions with yarn should be fine though. There are projects that really fail if npm/yarn is used instead of the other intended one 😅
Happy to hear it's running ok now though 👍


[11/13/2022 09:51] koolexc
That's true. I've had a similar case. due to the resolutions that works a bit differently in npm than yarn . Thank you 🙂

Who is expected to call the `bulkExecute` method? Users who are a participant in every transaction or will there be some server who also does that? Will they pay the ETH or how is that intended to work


[11/14/2022 08:31] saksham#7993
Any sponsor available for a DM?


[11/14/2022 16:18] contest-anon#6759
Technically, it is possible for anyone to call the bulkExecute method with the proper signatures, although if it's not the buyer, then the payment method couldn't be ETH


[11/14/2022 16:18] contest-anon#6759
You can dm me

@WarDog94reviewing/judging/compiling all the reports take some time, I suppose.


[11/15/2022 22:09] chaduke3730
This is more than grading a homework, since the judges do not know the answer either and they need to read the code to


[11/15/2022 22:10] chaduke3730
and be a good judge case-by-case (so many submissions to review as well)

This contest was an exact copy of the blur code with a couple of modifications. It turns out that they did an stealth audit under a fantasy name. https://twitter.com/code4rena/status/1600241973075775488

It's a reputational risk if our work is used as promotional material but the report is not out, so I've recomended C4 to change the TOS in such a way that if a sponsor writes about the contest results, we are free to share the contest findings (else the info asymmetry can be used to mislead)
